## What is it

SlyFox is a Lightweight, minimalistic energy and combopoint tracker addon for Wow TBC 2.4.3.

It also features energy tick tracking, bar smoothing and autohiding out of combat.

## How to configure

Currently there is no in-game config, so you will need edit the SlyFox.lua file to change the trackers position and size. 
To do so, simply open the file in your favorite text editor, change what you want and save the file. Followed by a /run ReloadUI() in games chat to load the changes!

## How to install

Go to Releases in https://github.com/nullfoxh/SlyFox/releases and download SlyFox.zip. Extract it to your World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns folder and you're done! Path should look like World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns/SlyFox/SlyFox.toc.
